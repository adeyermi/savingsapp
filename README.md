📝 How It Works

1. ## Register a Student
   | Fill in your name.  
   | Select a savings tier.  
   | Click “Add Student”.  
   | Your contribution, weekly interest, and total amount appear in the dashboard.  

2. ## Withdraw Funds
   | Click the **Withdraw** button next to your name.  
   | Confirms the action and removes you from the group.  
   | Dashboard updates automatically.  

3. ## Persistence  
   | All data is stored in the browser using `localStorage`.  
   | Refreshing the page does **not** erase your contributions.
